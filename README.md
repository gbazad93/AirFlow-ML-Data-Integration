# AirFlow-ML-Data-Integration

This project demonstrates how to use [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) for orchestrating a daily ETL pipeline that fetches weather data from the free OpenWeather API, cleans and transforms the data, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. It provides a scalable and reproducible example that can be extended for machine learning tasks such as training predictive models on weather-related datasets.

## Overview
This repository offers a sample Airflow project integrating a daily weather data fetch from OpenWeather’s free API into a PostgreSQL database. The data is cleaned, validated, and ready for further downstream tasks, such as ML model training or dashboard visualization.

## Features
- **Automated Orchestration:** Daily scheduled runs controlled by Airflow.
- **Data Cleaning & Validation:** Ensures consistent, reliable data for analysis.
- **Modular Design:** Separate files for DAGs, database connection, and data processing.
- **Easily Extensible:** Add more cities, transformations, or ML tasks as needed.
