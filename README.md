# AirFlow-ML-Data-Integration

This project demonstrates how to use [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) for orchestrating a daily ETL pipeline that fetches weather data from the free OpenWeather API, cleans and transforms the data, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. It provides a scalable and reproducible example that can be extended for machine learning tasks such as training predictive models on weather-related datasets.
