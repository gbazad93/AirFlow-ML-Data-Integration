# AirFlow-ML-Data-Integration

This project demonstrates how to use [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) for orchestrating a daily ETL pipeline that fetches weather data from the free OpenWeather API, cleans and transforms the data, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. It provides a scalable and reproducible example that can be extended for machine learning tasks such as training predictive models on weather-related datasets.

## Overview
This repository offers a sample Airflow project integrating a daily weather data fetch from OpenWeatherâ€™s free API into a PostgreSQL database. The data is cleaned, validated, and ready for further downstream tasks, such as ML model training or dashboard visualization.
