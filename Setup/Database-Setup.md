# Database Setup: PostgreSQL for Airflow Integration

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, and feature-rich relational database management system. It is highly reliable and performs well for handling complex queries and large datasets, making it an excellent choice for data-intensive projects like orchestrating ETL pipelines in Apache Airflow.

### Why Use PostgreSQL?
- **Robustness:** Offers ACID compliance for reliable transactions.
- **Scalability:** Handles large volumes of data and high-concurrency workloads effectively.
- **Extensibility:** Supports custom functions, extensions (like PostGIS), and JSON for semi-structured data.
- **Cross-Platform:** Available on multiple operating systems with consistent functionality.

In this project, PostgreSQL is used to store weather data fetched and processed by Apache Airflow DAGs.

## Step 1: Install PostgreSQL
First, install PostgreSQL and its command-line tools:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

### Step 2: Start and Enable PostgreSQL Service

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL service
sudo systemctl start postgresql

# Enable PostgreSQL to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable postgresql

# Check the status of the PostgreSQL service
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```
### Step 3: Access PostgreSQL CLI

```bash
# Switch to the postgres user
sudo -u postgres psql
```

### Step 4: Create the Database and User

Once inside the PostgreSQL CLI, run the following commands to create a database and a user for Airflow:

```sql
-- Create the weather_data database
CREATE DATABASE weather_data;

-- Create a user for Airflow with a secure password
CREATE USER airflow_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';

-- Grant all privileges on the weather_data database to the user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE weather_data TO airflow_user;
```
### Step 5: Create the Weather Data Table

Switch to the `weather_data` database and create a table to store weather-related information. Run the following commands in the PostgreSQL CLI:

```sql
-- Connect to the weather_data database
\c weather_data

-- Create the weather table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS weather (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50),
    date DATE,
    temperature NUMERIC,
    humidity NUMERIC,
    wind_speed NUMERIC,
    weather_condition VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
This table is designed to store essential weather data, such as:

- **city**: The name of the city.
- **date**: The date of the weather record.
- **temperature**: The recorded temperature.
- **humidity**: The humidity percentage.
- **wind_speed**: The wind speed measurement.
- **weather_condition**: A brief description of the weather condition.
- **created_at**: The timestamp when the record was created (automatically populated).

To verify the table creation, you can run:
```sql
\d weather
```
## Notes

- The `weather_data` database stores weather-related information such as city, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions. This data is ready for downstream tasks like machine learning model training or visualizations.
- Use strong passwords for database users to ensure security.
- The `created_at` column in the `weather` table automatically records the timestamp when a new row is added.
- When using the `\d weather` command in the PostgreSQL CLI, if the output ends with `(END)` and you cannot type, press **`q`** to exit the pager and return to the `psql` prompt.

## Optional: Using pgAdmin 4 for PostgreSQL Management

pgAdmin 4 is a powerful and user-friendly GUI for managing PostgreSQL databases. While using the PostgreSQL CLI is sufficient, pgAdmin provides a visual interface that can make managing databases more convenient. Follow these steps to install, configure, and use pgAdmin to connect to your database and view table content.

### Install pgAdmin 4

To install pgAdmin 4 on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y pgadmin4
```

### Open pgAdmin 4

You can open pgAdmin 4 in two ways:

1. **Through Terminal**:
   - Launch pgAdmin by running:
     ```
     pgadmin4
     ```
   - It will open in your default web browser. If it doesnâ€™t open automatically, navigate to:
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:5050
     ```

2. **Through System Search**:
   - Press the **Super Key** (Windows key) and type **pgAdmin** in the search bar.
   - Click on the **pgAdmin 4** application icon to open it.

On the first run, you will be prompted to set up an email address and password to access pgAdmin.

### Connect to the PostgreSQL Database

1. Once pgAdmin is open, right-click **Servers** and select **Register > Server**.
2. In the **General** tab:
   - Enter a name for your server (e.g., "weather_data").
3. In the **Connection** tab:
   - **Host name/address**: `localhost` (or the server's IP address if remote).
   - **Port**: `5432` (default PostgreSQL port).
   - **Maintenance database**: `weather_data`.
   - **Username**: `airflow_user`.
   - **Password**: Enter the password set for `airflow_user`.
   - Save the connection details.

4. Click **Save** to connect to the database.

### View Table Content

To view the content of your table in pgAdmin 4, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Using the Schema Browser
1. In the left-hand menu, expand **Servers > weather_data > Schemas > public > Tables**.
2. Click on the `weather` table to highlight it.
3. Right-click the `weather` table and select **View/Edit Data > All Rows** to view its contents directly.

#### Option 2: Using the Query Tool
1. In the left-hand menu, expand **Servers > weather_data > Schemas > public > Tables**.
2. Right-click the `weather` table and select **Query Tool**.
3. In the query editor, type the following query to view the table's content:
   ```
   SELECT * FROM weather;
   ```
4. Click the **Execute/Run** button (lightning bolt icon) to execute the query and see the results.
